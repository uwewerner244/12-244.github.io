## What Is a Curriculum Vitae? ##

**Curriculum vitae** (CV) provides a summary of one’s experience and skills.

CVs include information on one’s academic background, including teaching experience, degrees, research, awards, publications, presentations, and other achievements. CVs are thus much longer than resumes, and include more information, particularly related to academic background.

A curriculum vitae summary is a one-to-two-page, condensed version of a full curriculum vitae. A CV summary is a way to quickly and concisely convey one’s skills and qualifications. Sometimes large organizations will ask for a one-page CV summary when they expect a large pool of applicants.
